# Data Entry for the Store
Building a web app for faster data entry into squarespace. 
Goals: 
 * make data entry easy
 * make retrieval of specific ranges of SKUs easy
 * make this site code easy to update forms and add new form types with little experience

## Overall structure
Like most web pages, this is comprised of a data entry form, which sends information to the server, which stores it in a database.  
Store staff will retrieve the data from the database using ranges of SKUs or sets of commands (ex. New SKUs since last retrieval)
